# This is Displayed if a Player tries to light a Portal and Visiting Nether is not allowed.
# Note: This will only show if the Player uses Flint & Steel or a Fire Charge to light the Portal,
#  if they light it using Burning Wood or something the Plugin will not be able to tell who tried to light it.
#  the portal still won't light though, the message just can't be sent.
