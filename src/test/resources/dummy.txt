This file has essentially no purpose other than it stops github from compacting the test folder
into "test/java/me/wilkai/deathswap/test", instead just showing "test".

This makes the project easier to navigate over there because I always end up clicking on the test
folder because it stands out much more than "main".

This file is not included in the compiled plugin so don't worry about space issues.

It is here to tidy up the project and here it shall stay.
